# TEDS Datasets
From the TEDS codebook:
The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) system serves as a repository of treatment data routinely collected by states for the purposes of monitoring their substance use treatment systems. It is comprised of selected data items from statesâ€™ administrative records that are converted to a standardized format which is consistent across all states. These standardized data constitute TEDS.
The TEDS system is comprised of two major components: the admissions dataset ([TEDS-A](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/treatment-episode-data-set-admissions-teds-nid13518)) and the discharges dataset ([TEDS-D](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/treatment-episode-data-set-discharges-teds-d-nid13520)). Data for theTEDS-Admissions (TEDS-A) file were first reported in 1992, while data for the TEDS-D were first reported in 2000.


# Experiments on TEDS-D 2017
Initial analysis are performed on the [2017 discharge dataset](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/teds-d-2017-ds0001-teds-d-2017-ds0001-nid18480). Refer to the [codebook](https://wwwdasis.samhsa.gov/dasis2/teds_pubs/TEDS/Discharges/TEDS_D_2017/TEDSD-2017-C.pdf) for details.
